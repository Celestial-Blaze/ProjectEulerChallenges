### Notes
- __Spoiler Alert__: my solutions might spoil the fun if you're trying to solve the same challenges
- My solutions are not necessarily all complete and can also be wrong and probably won't be optimized
- The challenge can be found here: [https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges)
- Hint (if you would like): all of these challenges require some math algorithm or optimization technique that is a reference to the legend Euler himself, which is pretty cool
